# Print-Binary-Number-using-Queue.
Queue example code
Take an integer n from the user as input and use a queue to print
binary values of each integer from 1 to n. Here is how it can be
done.
o Create an empty queue
o Enqueue the first binary number “1” to the queue.
o Now run a loop for generating and printing n binary
numbers.
? Dequeue and print the value.
? Append “0” at the dequeued value and enqueue it.
? Append “1” at the dequeued value and enqueue it.
